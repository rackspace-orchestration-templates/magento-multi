  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Magento Community Edition, the [Magento User
  Guide](http://www.magentocommerce.com/resources/user-guide-download) will
  step you through the process of configuring and managing your store. This
  guide is free, but does require you to provide a valid email address to
  receive it.

  The [Magento Forum](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/) provides a place
  to get answers to both simple and advanced questions regarding configuration
  and management of Magento Community Edition.

  #### Logging into Magento
  To login, go to the URL listed above in a browser. If your DNS is not
  pointing to this installation, you can add a line in your [hosts
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  to point your domain to the IP of this Cloud Server. Once you've done this,
  restart your browser and navigate to the site. The backend can be accessed by
  adding '/admin' to the end of the URL, and you can login with the credentials
  provided above.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  A system user named 'magento' has been created.  This user does not have a
  password set, so if you wish to use the account, a password will need to be
  set.  This account is the system user for PHP-FPM, so deletion of this user
  will take eCommerce site down.
  
  [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) is used as the web server and listens on port
  80 and 443 to handle web traffic. The configuration for your site can be
  found in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. There will be a default site
  configuration, and a seperate one for SSL traffic. Magento itself is
  installed in /var/www/vhosts. You will find a directory with the name of
  website you entered as a part of this deployment. The SSL certificates used
  are self signed and were generated when this deployment was created. You can
  replace the private key and certificate by overwriting the ones in
  /etc/nginx/ssl.

  [PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) is used to handle
  evaluation of all PHP-based pages. The configuration for this installation is
  in /etc/php5/fpm/pools/magento.conf. By default, PHP-FPM is running as the
  'magento' user, listens on port 9001.

  Object and session caching are handled by
  [Memcached](http://www.memcached.org/).  Memcache helps performance by
  storing data in memory for faster responses to clients. These caches help
  lessen the number of queries required to the database.  There are two
  seperate instances of Memcached running to ensure session and object caching
  are handled seperately.  The session cache is listening on port 11211,
  and is set as a 512MB cache.  The object cache is listening on
  port 11212, and it is set as a 1.5GB cache.  The configuration files are
  memcached_sessions.conf and memcached_backend.conf in /etc on the database
  server.

  [MySQL 5.5](http://www.mysql.com/) is installed as the database backend. All
  configuration with Magento has been handled as a part of the setup. The MySQL
  root password is provided as a part of this deployment.  If you lose or
  forget the password, it can also be found in /root/.my.cnf.

  MySQL backups are performed nightly by
  [Holland](https://github.com/holland-backup/holland). Backups can be found in
  /var/lib/mysqlbackup on the Database server

  #### Magento Plugins
  There are thousands of plugins that have been developed for Magento by the
  developer community. [Magento
  Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/) provides an easy
  way to discover popular plugins that other users have found to be helpful.
  Not all plugins are free, and we recommend only installing the plugins that
  you need.

  #### Additional Notes
  There is not an automatic way to add additional nodes to this deployment. The
  recommended way to grow the web capacity is to snapshot one of the web nodes,
  then build a new server with it. Add the newly created server to the lsync
  configuration on the master server, and restart the lsycnd service. Also, add
  the ServiceNet IP to the list of allowed IP's in the PHP-FPM configuration on
  the master node, and restart the PHP-FPM service. Add firewall rules on the
  Database server to permit traffic from the ServiceNet IP of the newly created
  server to ports 11211 and 11212 (the caches). Once this is done, and you've
  verified that lsync is syncing content from the master node to the new
  server, add the server to the HTTP and HTTPS load balancers that were created
  as a part of this configuration.
